# Introduction 

This is a mini project where I put my knowledge of data structures into practice.

The program manages the stock of a small store.

The program uses a **VECTOR** to store product information and allows the user to add, remove and consult products in stock.

**The project has 3 classes:** 

- List: This is a custom implementation of a generic list data structure

- Product: This class is a blueprint for creating objects representing products in a stock management system

- Main: Responsible for code execution
